# WARNING: this file is reprepro-specific. Although it should not overwrite any 
# existing nginx configuration files, the "listen 80" option might conflict with 
# other files and prevent nginx and/or some sites from working properly.

	listen 80;

	listen [::]:80 default ipv6only=on;

	# This will filter down to location directives
	root   <%= documentroot %>;

	# The server_name directive seems to be needed even if we're not hosting 
	# several domains. If it's not enabled, the browser might get confused 
	# and direct us to a search engine.

		allow all;

	# Block requests to directories internally used by reprepro. 
	# Additionally make these directories root:root and 700 so that nginx 
	# can't read them even if it wanted. Both of these approaches work as 
	# intended. the \w* after apt/ makes sure the regular expression only 
	# matches one directory level.
